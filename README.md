Truck Travel - is a site for convenient and most importantly quick booking of motorhomes for vacation/travel

There are only 4 pages on the site, so even a child can understand it.
HomePage is the main page of the site. It has a button that will take you to the catalog page.
CatalogPage - on this page is all available motorhomes that you can rent. Also there is filtration by body type or specification of the car and the location where this car is located.
You can also find out detailed information about the car or add it to your favorites list.
DetalisPage - on this page you can read detailed information about the selected motorhome. Read reviews and book a car
FavoritePage - in this part of the site you can save your favorite motorhomes. From this page you can also go to the DetalisPage and find out all the information you need
